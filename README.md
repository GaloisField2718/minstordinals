# Goal 

Create a new [json-based protocol](https://medium.com/@MySsistant/what-is-the-ordinals-protocol-that-brc20-tokens-are-based-on-a1ebe4f00f96) on top of [Ordinals](https://docs.ordinals.com/) related to minsta NFTs.

## Idea ðŸ’¡

When you mint a nft via minsta it triggers a transaction on Ordinals with pushing a json which should looks like : 
```json
{
  "p": "minsta",
  "op" : "mint",
  "minsta-account" : "my_account.minsta.near",
  "minsta_id" : "aef...",
  "file" : "https://mintbase.com/aef...",
  "meta" : "Your description and much more coming soon ;)"
}
```

## Why this idea ?

We can also think about a two step push with pushing image on Ordinals and after trigger a `minsta mint` operation but it will more expensive. Minsta is already stored on [arweave](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/).

So, it's cheaper and it's a first easy implementation of a cross protocol between mintbase and ordinal.

## Go beyond

What we can see with this technical purpose is anyone can mint a bitcoin only transaction without beeing related to mintbase.

To solve this issue, the Near BOS with indexers could be solution. We will try to show you how it can works in theory to be sure that only valid inscriptions regarding minsta mints are valid to use into Near Ecosystem.
